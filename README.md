In order to launch the test, requirements must be installed. 

Assuming Python (pip) is already installed into the local machine:
1. Open terminal in the root folder 
2. Run command `pip install -r .\reqs.txt`. This should install all necessary packages
3. After successful install, proceed to "pythonProject" folder in terminal
4. Run command `robot .\Tests` to run all tests in the "Tests" folder. At the moment, there is just a single file with all the test steps
5. Test execution results are visible in "pythonProject" folder in "report.html" and "log.html"
